### Updated README for Notepad++

---

## What is Notepad++?

Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in "free beer") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several programming languages and natural languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by the GPL License.

## Why another source code editor?

The company I worked for used JEXT (another open-source code editor in Java) as the production tool. Due to its poor performance, I began an investigation to find another solution (in C++ instead of in Java) in September 2003. I found Scintilla and built a prototype. (Fortunately :) ) This solution was not accepted. I removed the specific part and continued to develop it in my leisure time. On the 25th of November 2003, it was made available on Sourceforge, hence the birth of Notepad++.

## Additional Features in This Repository

This repository includes a collection of personal problem-solving scripts written in **Assembly language**. These solutions serve as examples of low-level programming techniques and are valuable resources for learning and experimentation.

## How to Install:

**From the installer:**  
Just follow the install wizard.

**From the zip/7z package:**
